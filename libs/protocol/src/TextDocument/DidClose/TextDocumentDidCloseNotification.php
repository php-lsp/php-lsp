 * The document close notification is sent from the client to the server when
 * the document got closed in the client. The document's truth now exists where
 * the document's uri points to (e.g. if the document's uri is a file uri the
 * truth now exists on disk). As with the open notification the close notification
 * is about managing the document's content. Receiving a close notification
 * doesn't mean that the document was open in an editor before. A close
 * notification requires a previous open notification to be sent.
