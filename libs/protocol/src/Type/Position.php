/**
 * Position in a text document expressed as zero-based line and character
 * offset. Prior to 3.17 the offsets were always based on a UTF-16 string
 * representation. So a string of the form `a𐐀b` the character offset of the
 * character `a` is 0, the character offset of `𐐀` is 1 and the character
 * offset of b is 3 since `𐐀` is represented using two code units in UTF-16.
 * Since 3.17 clients and servers can agree on a different string encoding
 * representation (e.g. UTF-8). The client announces it's supported encoding
 * via the client capability [`general.positionEncodings`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#clientCapabilities).
 * The value is an array of position encodings the client supports, with
 * decreasing preference (e.g. the encoding at index `0` is the most preferred
 * one). To stay backwards compatible the only mandatory encoding is UTF-16
 * represented via the string `utf-16`. The server can pick one of the
 * encodings offered by the client and signals that encoding back to the
 * client via the initialize result's property
 * [`capabilities.positionEncoding`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#serverCapabilities). If the string value
 * `utf-16` is missing from the client's capability `general.positionEncodings`
 * servers can safely assume that the client supports UTF-16. If the server
 * omits the position encoding in its initialize result the encoding defaults
 * to the string value `utf-16`. Implementation considerations: since the
 * conversion from one encoding into another requires the content of the
 * file / line the conversion is best done where the file is read which is
 * usually on the server side.
 *
 * Positions are line end character agnostic. So you can not specify a position
 * that denotes `\r|\n` or `\n|` where `|` represents the character offset.
 *
 * @generated
 * @since 3.17.0 - support for negotiated position encoding.
